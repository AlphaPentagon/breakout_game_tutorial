I'm using the above tutorial to learn more about the Canvas API in vanilla JS, and also to solidify my understanding of general programming logic and game logic.

At each step of the tutorial I am adding new features e.g. changing the ball colour each time it hits a surface, increasing the score amount depending on the amount of bricks destoryed.

I have also substitued arrow functions for the regular functions, to make my code neater, and where appropriate changed variable names and formats so that they are more readable.

Once the tutorial is complete, I hope to add in a few extra features such as background music and sound effects, and possibly changing canvas backgrounds.
